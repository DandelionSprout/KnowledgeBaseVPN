How does it work? Without going into technical details, we can say that VPN creates a secure encrypted tunnel between the user's computer or mobile device and a remote VPN server. In this way, data confidentiality is preserved, as well as the anonymity of the user, because a third-party observer sees the IP address of the VPN server and not the actual user's IP. VPN is frequently used for: Keeping personal data safe even while using public Wi-FiPreventing online activity tracking by masking the IP addressHiding the real geolocation to remain anonymous AdGuard VPN for Android can do it all for you — and even offer something unique. To find out why AdGuard VPN is the better option — read this article.

On the same screen, there are also a Connect/Disconnect button and a list of available servers. Each server has its location and its ping rate, describing the response time of the server. The lower this rate, the faster is your connection. The fastest options are always displayed at the top of the list which consists of more than 50 locations in dozens of countries. You can connect to the fastest server by tapping the Connect/Disconnect button or by picking a location. "},{"title":"Exclusions​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Features overview","url":"adguard-vpn-for-android/overview/#exclusions","content":"We've done everything to make it easy for you to manage your site and app exclusion lists.

"},{"title":"Lists of exclusions​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Features overview","url":"adguard-vpn-for-android/overview/#lists-of-exclusions","content":"The exclusion lists allow you to select sites for which the VPN should be enabled and for which — disabled. To reach the Exclusions section, tap the second icon from the left at the bottom of the screen. There are two modes: in General mode sites from the exclusions list are excluded, and in Selective mode, they will be the only ones where AdGuard VPN works. You can add domains (e.g. google.com) or subdomains (e.g. *.google.com) of websites to the Exclusions in three ways: enter them manually in the app or right from the browser by clicking the Share button and selecting AdGuard VPN in the opened list below. You can also add them from built-in lists of services divided by categories.  There are some nuances in manual adding domains. For example, if you manually exclude the domain yahoo.com, all *.yahoo.com subdomains will also be listed in exclusions. However, domain names with other top-level domains, such as yahoo.jp or yahoo.fr, will not be excluded. Or you can add youtube.com to the exclusions, but the domain of the same service youtu.be will not get into the list. In this case, it’s more safe to use built-in lists of services, because we put there all subdomains related to each platform. As you can enable subdomains in service lists, we added boxes that reflect the status of each service — you can see them on the main screen of Exclusions to the left of each service name: fully-enabled status is marked with a white check mark on green background, fully-disabled — with a gray box, and partly-enabled, which means that one or more parameters were changed — with a green square on white background. Good news: you can always return to the default view of service lists in case you’ve deleted or disabled any domains from there.  Another useful feature is Import/Export exclusions. There are only four steps to reach the goal: Open AdGuard VPN on the device/in the browser from where you want to export your lists of exclusions. Find the appropriate section and click the Export button.

Any of these services can be added to Exclusions in one click! It's especially convenient if you use Selective mode. Exclusion list can be easily configured. If you've added a domain and some of its subdomains, they'll be grouped inside the root one. When adding a root domain (example.com) its mask is added too (*.example.com). If you've added a service, changed or removed something and now want to recover initial settings, just press Reset to default next to the domain — this action will restore any missing domains and tick all checkboxes.

How does it work? Every time you visit a website without using a VPN, your ISP sees it. It knows who you are and what you're looking for, and it can collect and sell this data. In it's turn, the website you came to can also track your activity. When you enable a VPN application, it redirects your traffic through an encrypted tunnel to a remote VPN server, ensuring your privacy: the ISP doesn't know where to you sent a request, and the site doesn't know where you came from. What does AdGuard VPN for Windows do Protects from network traffic interception (spoofing). AdGuard VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and a remote server. All your Internet traffic passes through this tunnel, so your data is protected along the way. And thanks to AdGuard's unique protocol, you're guaranteed a fast and secure connection. Masks your IP address. Your true IP address is the key to your personal data for cybercriminals. Your name, email address, phone number, credit card information can all fall into the hands of fraudsters if you don't hide your IP. With AdGuard VPN, as we said before, all your traffic goes through an encrypted tunnel and comes to the VPN server. Therefore, from the outside it appears that your device has the IP address of said VPN server. Hides your real location. By selecting any of the AdGuard VPN servers, you are instantly &quot;teleported&quot; to its location. What does this give you? For example, the ability to book a hotel at locals' rates or hide from geotargeted advertising. AdGuard VPN for Windows has many advantages, so we've dedicated a separate article to them. Here, however, we want to focus more on the application itself and how it works. "},{"title":"How to start using AdGuard VPN for Windows​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Features overview","url":"adguard-vpn-for-windows/overview/#how-to-start-using-adguard-vpn-for-windows","content":"To start using AdGuard VPN for Windows, download the app from our website. The installation takes no more than a minute — and you'll see a dialog window where you'll need to check at least one box applying the terms of the User Agreement and the Privacy Policy. And it's up to you to decide whether you want AdGuard to collect anonymized data about your app usage. At last the program will ask you to sign in, either via AdGuard account or via social networks (Apple, Google, Facebook). That's all, you can now use AdGuard VPN for Windows.

On the right side of the screen you will find all available locations, and the fastest, i.e. with the shortest ping, will be listed at the top of the list. At the top of the screen there is a navigation panel with four tabs: Home, Exclusions, Support, Settings. With the first tab done, let's move on. "},{"title":"Exclusions​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Features overview","url":"adguard-vpn-for-windows/overview/#exclusions","content":"AdGuard VPN for Windows can work in two modes: General or Selective. What does this mean? If you want the application to work on all but a few sites, activate the General mode and list the resources you want to exclude from the tunnel. The Selective mode has the opposite effect: it activates AdGuard VPN only on the websites specified in the exclusion list. Please note that these two modes' exclusions lists are independent from one another.  There are two options for creating exclusions lists: Manually and From the list. Click the Add a website line and choose the format you prefer for adding sites to the exclusions.   When adding domains manually, you should take into account some nuances. For example, if you manually exclude the domain google.com, all the subdomains *.google.com will also be added to the exclusions list. However, domain names with other top-level domains such as google.es or google.it will not be excluded. Or you can add youtube.com to the exclusions, but the domain of the same service youtu.be will not be included in the list. We would recommend to use the option From the list to avoid unnecessary hassle. We have already grouped eight different categories of popular services for you: Social networks, Messengers, Video and Music streaming services, Games, Shopping, Search engines, and Work communication tools. We have placed the most popular services there, including all domain names and subdomains related to each platform. That way you will be certain you haven't forgotten any service or domain you'd like to keep functioning while VPN is on, or vice versa.

Let's look closer at two of them: General and Split tunneling. "},{"title":"General​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Features overview","url":"adguard-vpn-for-windows/overview/#general","content":"The General section contains many useful features. Here you can set the app language and also enable Kill Switch, which will block access to the Internet if your VPN connection fails. This is needed to prevent intruders from getting to your data if you find yourself without VPN protection while connected to a public Wi-Fi or mobile network. You can also activate the following features with a single click: Autoupdate, Launch AdGuard VPN at Windows startup, Auto-connect on app launch, and allow AdGuard to collect anonymized app usage data so that we can make it better. Here you can also change the default Light Theme to a Dark Theme. At the bottom of the page there are two sections: DNS servers and Advanced settings.  DNS servers​ The DNS servers tab allows you to add your own custom DNS server. Why should you do this? For example, not to rely on the default DNS server, which is often controlled by your ISP. You can set up a DNS server by any provider. We recommend adding AdGuard DNS, a server that can protect against advertising, tracking and phishing in addition to the standard functions. Advanced Settings​ It is entirely possible to use AdGuard VPN for Windows without ever touching the Advanced settings, but they can be useful if you're willing to take time to learn what they do. Operating Mode Despite the fact that there are two operating modes — VPN and SOCKS5 — we advise you to use only the one chosen by default (VPN). When the VPN mode is enabled, all the traffic of your device will be directed via AdGuard VPN, while in SOCKS5 mode AdGuard VPN uses a local proxy server which can be used by other applications to redirect their traffic. Logging level Two levels of logging are available to choose from: Record by default and Record everything. The first option is enabled by default. The Record everything option should only be activated if our support team has asked you to do so. Using the app in this mode for an extended period of time result in increased battery consumption. All logs are stored locally on your device and you can send them to the support team if needed. Use QUIC This is an experimental feature that enables AdGuard to use the advanced QUIC encryption protocol. It has many advantages, but the most notable one is that it can improve connection quality under non-ideal conditions, for example, when using mobile Internet or when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks.

And in 2019 we resolved to develop our own VPN service, seemingly out of nowhere. When in reality, there were a few reasons that prompted us to do so. AdGuard mobile apps had compatibility issues with VPN apps. Normally, two VPN-based mobile apps can't work together: in rare cases on iOS, and never on Android. As AdGuard ad blocker apps use local VPN to filter network traffic, using them alongside any VPN app would be out of the question. That's why we saw the development of an in-house VPN as the only feasible solution that could guarantee compatibility: after we apply some magic, the two apps are able to work together as one VPN service.Secondly, VPN seemed more than relevant to our philosophy and priorities. Our primary goal is to protect users' privacy, and this is exactly what VPNs are for.Finally, over the years of developing AdGuard software, we have become experts in filtering network traffic. This allowed us to bring in something new instead of becoming another wishy-washy VPN. From the outset, we decided that AdGuard VPN would have one key difference from its competitors — we shall develop and deploy an in-house VPN protocol which would not force users to choose between security and speed.

To &quot;conceal&quot; the use of VPN, the data flow is often &quot;wrapped&quot; in a TCP connection, and sometimes it is additionally encrypted to make the traffic look like a normal website connection. Unfortunately, this approach has a disadvantage – due to the use of TCP, there is a need for additional confirmation of delivery.  Using any popular VPN protocol, we are always facing a trade-off: fast but easy to detect vs. slow. "},{"title":"What's great about AdGuard VPN protocol​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How AdGuard VPN protocol works","url":"general/adguard-vpn-protocol/#whats-great-about-adguard-vpn-protocol","content":" It's nearly impossible to distinguish from normal HTTPS traffic, that is, the connection to the AdGuard VPN server looks exactly the same as the connection to a normal website.For encryption we use HTTPS (TLS), which copes with this task perfectly. It is the most popular encryption method in the world, and the libraries that implement it are constantly audited for security. Some existing VPN protocols also handle the encryption task, and they (and thus, the fact of using a VPN) are hard to detect. But this usually comes at the price of reduced speed. This is not our case, thanks to several solutions. We use the HTTP/2 transport protocol, which makes it virtually impossible to detect AdGuard VPN protocol while maintaining high speed.Unlike others, AdGuard VPN protocol operates with data and not with packets. This means that AdGuard VPN establishes a separate &quot;tunnel&quot; for each connection, each HTTP/2 stream corresponds to one connection. AdGuard VPN transfers data through this tunnel. This allows us to speed up the operation by saving on confirmation packets, because we can buffer the data of several packets into one before sending it to the VPN server (or from the server to the client). And the fewer packets, the fewer confirmations are needed.

A VPN connects a computer or a mobile device to a VPN server and uses the IP address of this server to make it seem to an outside observer that you are in another place. This allows you to securely access various Internet resources and protect your personal data. In that way, a VPN performs two important functions: Maintaining anonymity Using an Internet connection, the user leaves their digital footprint, which can then be analyzed and used by third parties. For example, one of the online stores that you have visited can save your search history and then offer you their products based on it through targeted advertising. Or the secret services, having learned your location through the IP address of your device and having determined your identity, can secretly monitor your activity on the web. In addition, web browsers and ISPs themselves can use your browsing history for their own purposes, as well as sell it to advertisers and provide it to government institutions. VPN allows you to hide your IP address and replace it with the IP address of the VPN server to which you are connected. This way you will be able to maintain your privacy and anonymously search for information on the web. Data protection If you connect to an unreliable or public network, the data on your device may become vulnerable to cybercriminals. Bank card details, usernames and passwords, passport data — all this data can be intercepted by online fraudsters. The VPN tunnel encrypts the information that you send and receive from the web, so it can not fall into the wrong hands. "},{"title":"VPN structure​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How VPN works","url":"general/how-vpn-works/#vpn-structure","content":"When you connect to a network, your computer or mobile device is assigned a unique ID number, or IP address. It usually consists of numbers from 0 to 255, separated by dots or colons. Knowing this sequence, one can determine the geolocation of the device. The IP address is usually set by your ISP, and it will be visible all the way to the desired resource. For this reason, the web server of the site you are visiting can register your IP address and record what you have requested. This record can then be used primarily for data collection and traffic analysis. A VPN creates a tunnel between your device and the VPN server. Your data goes through this tunnel, gets encrypted and then enters the open Internet in a secure form. Therefore, it will seem to the web server that your device has no longer your real IP address, but the IP address of the endpoint of the tunnel, that is, the VPN server. Thus, the site that you get to after passing through the VPN tunnel will consider the geolocation of the VPN server you selected as your real location. And the encrypted data will not fall into the hands of advertisers, hackers and security services.  "},{"title":"Types of VPN protocols​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How VPN works","url":"general/how-vpn-works/#types-of-vpn-protocols","content":"VPN security protocols are tools that encrypt data in a VPN tunnel and allow you to maintain user privacy in an open Internet. At the moment, the vast majority of modern VPN services use one of the following three VPN protocols: IPSec. One of its main advantages is that it is available on most devices and operating systems and provides a high level of security. However, the use of double encapsulation in this protocol may result in a lower connection speed. OpenVPN. This modern protocol is open source, so third-party manufacturers can improve and update the technology. WireGuard. Its main advantages are ease of use, high efficiency and low vulnerability to attacks. In addition to these VPN protocols, there are others (for example, TLS, SSTP, IKEv2), but they are unpopular or do not meet modern data encryption standards.  AdGuard VPN also has its own protocol. One of its advantages is that the traffic transmitted using the AdGuard VPN protocol is difficult to distinguish from the regular traffic. The VPN tunnel looks like normal HTTPS traffic, so it is extremely difficult to detect and block it. In addition, it is based on the mechanisms of the modern HTTP/2 protocol, which ensures high connection speed.  "},{"title":"VPN drawbacks​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How VPN works","url":"general/how-vpn-works/#vpn-drawbacks","content":"Despite the obvious advantages, VPN is not perfect and has some disadvantages: Lower speed Since your traffic does not go directly to the web server, but first passes through the VPN server, the speed of the VPN connection decreases. Other factors also affect the speed when using a VPN: the load of the VPN server, its bandwidth, the compatibility of the VPN protocol with your operating system. All these factors, as well as the speed of the network itself, can reduce the quality of your VPN connection. Access blocking Some online services make a lot of effort to detect VPN traffic and block access to VPN users. However, not many VPNs can mask their traffic as regular. Therefore, many attempts to go to a particular website without disabling VPN end up in nothing. VPN connections breaking A weak signal, network overload, VPN incompatibility with a firewall, antivirus and other programs, an outdated VPN protocol — all this can cause a sudden failure in the VPN connection, especially by unreliable VPN providers.
